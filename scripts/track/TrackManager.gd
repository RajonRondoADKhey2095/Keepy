extends Node3D
## Spawns track segments ahead of the player and recycles them once
## they pass behind -- a fixed-size object pool, never queue_free() /
## re-instantiate in the running loop.
##
## Architecture note -- the WORLD moves toward the static player
## instead of the player moving through the world. Keepy never
## advances on Z (see Keepy.gd); every frame this script instead
## nudges each TrackSegment's Z position toward the player by the
## current run speed. This keeps every moving Node3D's coordinates
## bounded to a small range around the origin forever, which avoids
## the floating point precision loss a genuinely unbounded player
## Z coordinate would eventually introduce (visible transform jitter
## after enough kilometers of "real" travel on a 32-bit float). It
## also means recycling a segment is just "move it back to the front
## and repopulate its contents" -- no allocation, no destruction.
